      **Seventeen** is a thirteen-member K-pop boy group formed by Pledis Entertainment in South Korea.
      Despite the name "Seventeen," they actually consist of thirteen talented individuals: S.Coups, Jeonghan,
      Joshua, Jun, Hoshi, Wonwoo, Woozi, DK, Mingyu, The8, Seungkwan, Vernon, and Dino. They are known for their
      impressive self-producing abilities, as many of their songs are composed and choreographed by the members
      themselves. Seventeen has garnered a massive following worldwide, affectionately known as “Carats.”
      They officially debuted on May 26, 2015, with the EP **17 Carat**, which became the longest-charting K-pop
      album of the year in the U.S. and helped them gain significant attention internationally.

      What sets Seventeen apart from many other K-pop groups is their intricate synchronization on stage and
      the fact that they divide themselves into three sub-units: the Hip-Hop Unit, the Vocal Unit, and the
      Performance Unit. Each sub-unit focuses on a specific area, showcasing their unique strengths. Their
      discography includes popular tracks like “Adore U,” “Mansae,” and “Very Nice,” and they have been
      recognized with numerous awards and nominations for their fresh concepts and powerful performances.
      With music spanning various genres—from bright pop to deeper, more introspective themes—Seventeen
      continues to broaden their artistic horizons. If you’re new to this fandom, or just curious about
      the group’s history, influences, and style, I hope this website provides a fun and informative overview!
