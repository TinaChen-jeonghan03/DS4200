    <p>
      Seventeen’s unique team structure is often described as a “self-producing idol group,”
      because many of their songs are composed and written by the members themselves.
      Woozi, for example, plays a significant role in songwriting and production, while
      Hoshi often contributes heavily to choreography. The group’s synergy is further enhanced
      by their three specialized sub-units:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hip-Hop Unit:</strong> S.Coups (leader), Wonwoo, Mingyu, and Vernon</li>
      <li><strong>Vocal Unit:</strong> Jeonghan, Joshua, Woozi, DK, and Seungkwan</li>
      <li><strong>Performance Unit:</strong> Hoshi, Jun, The8, and Dino</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Each sub-unit focuses on their respective areas—rap, vocals, and dance—allowing the group
      to excel across the board. Beyond musical artistry, Seventeen also actively engages in
      variety shows, concerts, and fan-oriented content that highlight their playful chemistry
      and warm bond. They regularly release behind-the-scenes videos, vlogs, and special
      projects to keep Carats connected and updated.

      One notable achievement in Seventeen’s career has been their ability to maintain a consistent
      presence on global music charts—testament to their international popularity. Their tours often
      sell out stadiums, bringing fans together from all over the world. For newcomers, diving into
      Seventeen’s music can be an exciting journey filled with energetic performances, heartfelt
      ballads, and an ever-growing discography. If you haven’t checked out their latest releases or
      watched their live stages, you’re definitely missing out on one of K-pop’s most dynamic groups!
